Designing a Throbber

<h3>Describe a bit about your throbber design (your concept and execution)<h3> 

The idea behind my throbber design came a bit out of nowhere, and while watching Daniel Schiffman’s (The Coding Train) videos on Youtube he gave an example of a code that made me able to make my design (the example is the video with the ball that bounces from wall to wall) it is not a throbber like Winnie showed it – it doesn’t spin but rather “pulsates” in a throbbing motion much like the word “throb” is defined in Winnie’s text. There is no underlying meaning of the color of my throbber, I just liked it… I wanted to challenge myself a bit more in this exercise and because I had a hard time figuring out how to use variables when coding I decided to make a throbber where almost the entire code evolves around variables. 

<h3>How may we use programming to reflect and inquire digital (visual) culture?<h3>

I am not sure if I understand this question correctly but I will try to answer it anyways.. When you learn to code you gradually begin to get a different perspective of everything that happens online. When you are introduced to the underlying processes of what you normally see on your computer screen you (or, for me at least) undergo a complete reappreciation of everything online (even the smallest things, like a buffering icon), because you get to work with it and try to create it for yourself and suddenly you know how much time that are actually put into making such small details.
